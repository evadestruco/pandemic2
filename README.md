This is the archive of Pandemic2, a continuation of the previous HvZ engine I built for UMASS Amherst.
I lost the repo for the live site, which still runs pandemic2, but this one is not too far behind it.

Current live version @ http://www.umasshvz.com 
(Site may experience periods of downtime during the summer when bills sometimes go unpaid for a bit)


The goals reached in this project:

- Device agnostic responsive design & functionalty
- Facebook Oauth2 Intergration
- Maintains player profiles and history
- Player geotracking and visualization of event activity
- Alternate registration flow for non-students into admin approval system
- Private squad portals and forums provide an area for players to plan and coordinate
- Robust administrative tools for moderators
- Intergrated ingame temporal mission event system
- can persist through multiple games
- has community building features like forums and squads built right in
- has advanced admin tools for creating missions and all sorts of game modifiers/variables
- utilizes mobile devices in new ways


It runs on the Web2py framework and uses bootstrap 3, require.js, masonry.js, prefixfree, and googlemaps.
