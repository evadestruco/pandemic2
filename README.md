Pandemic is the continuation of the previous HvZ engine I built for UMASS Amherst.

The goal of this project right now is to build a powerful & robust HvZ engine that:

- can persist through multiple games
- has community building features like forums and squads built right in
- has advanced admin tools for creating missions and all sorts of game modifiers/variables
- utilizes mobile devices in new ways
- has cool data visualizations 
- is portable and easy to install
